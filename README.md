# Janban

A kanban board written in Java.

## Phase 0

### What does it do?

Janban is a simple application which enables the user to manage their project goals and tasks in a visual manner through
the kanban system.

### Who is this for?

Janban is built for anyone who is working on or managing a complex project that needs to be broken down into small tasks
or goals.

### Why make this?

I have worked with many tools that implements a kanban board in the past, an example being a scrum project on Jira or
just a Trello board. However, most of these services are fully online, and also not as customizable. So Janban serves as
a applications which allows people to use a kanban board fully offline and is also fully customizable (it is open
source!).
