# Cinddit

Its like a blend of Tinder and Reddit but for code!

### What does it do?

Cinddit is a social media (prototype) that feels like a fusion of Tinder and Reddit which allows the users to browse and
share code snippets with others.

### Who is this for?

Cinddit is mainly built for developers (but is usable by anyone) who has too much free time or just simply want
to share cool snippets of code they wrote or found.

### Why make this?

There are many general social medias currently available (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc), however, there aren't many
exclusive for software developers or purpose built for discussions about code. Sites like Stackoverflow and GitHub
exist, but they are very specialized and not suited for general discussions. Cinddit serves as this general social media
built for developers who want to share code.
