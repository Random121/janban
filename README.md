# Janban

A kanban board for scrum written in Java.

### What does it do?

Janban is an application which enables the user to manage their project in a visual manner through the kanban system
with specific features for the scrum project management framework.

### Who is this for?

Janban is built for anyone who is working on or managing a complex project.

### Why make this?

I have worked with many tools that implements a kanban board in the past, an example being Jira or just a Trello board.
However, most of these services are fully online, and also not as customizable. So Janban serves as an applications
which allows people to use a kanban board fully offline and is also fully customizable (it is open source!).
